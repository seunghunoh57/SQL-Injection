This program finds a valid SQL injection input where the PHP script of a website
that encrypts its password using an MD5 but inputs raw binary into the password
query. This program takes advantage of that by using the fact that '=' will create
a False = False statement, which is true in MySQL binary. The program creates
random integer to be hashed, hash it, then check if '=' is part of the raw binary
input.
